## [v0.5.1] - 2022-09-05
[v0.5.1]: https://github.com/althonos/pytrimal/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1

### Fixed

[v0.5.0]: https://github.com/althonos/pytrimal/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0

### Added
- `pytrimal.RepresentativeTrimmer` class to trim by maximum identity or fixed number of cluster representatives.
- `pickle` protocol support for all trimmer classes.
- Conversion methods to convert an `Alignment` from and to Biopython or PyHMMER objects.
- Arm NEON implementation of the statistics computation algorithm, with speed-up similar to that of the SSE implementation.

### Fixed
- `std::streambuf` implementation based on the `readinto` Python method not working on Arm because of `char` being used to read ASCII.

### Removed
