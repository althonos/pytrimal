Examples
========

This section of the documentation contains code examples generated from
`Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebooks demonstrating how to use the
Python API in simple use-cases.

Feel free to open a new ticket on the `issue tracker <https://github.com/althonos/pytrimal/issues>`_
if you feel like some parts of the library are not covered sufficiently, or
if you have an interesting example to provide.
